An opinionated Laravel package to handle payments, complete with blade views, routing, and everything in-between.

Whether you want to quickly bootstrap payment processing for your Laravel applications, or you want a way to test supported payment processors, this package's got you!

> Although opinionated, this package allows you to "theme" the views. It achieves this theming by
> `@extend()`ing whatever view you specify in `config('laravel-multipay.extended_layout')` (defaults to `layout.app`).

## Requirements:
This package is [tested against:](https://github.com/damms005/laravel-multipay/blob/d1a15bf762ba2adabc97714f1565c6c0f0fcd58d/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml#L16-17)
- PHP ^8.2
- Laravel 11/12

## Currently supported payment handlers

Currently, this package supports the following online payment processors/handlers

-   [Paystack](https://paystack.com)
-   [Remita](http://remita.net)
-   [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com)**
-   [Interswitch](https://www.interswitchgroup.com)**
-   [UnifiedPayments](https://unifiedpayments.com)**

> [!NOTE]
> _key_:
> ** for the indicated providers, a few features may be missing. PRs welcomed if you cannot afford the wait ðŸ˜‰

> [!TIP]
> Your preferred payment handler is not yet supported? Please consider [opening the appropriate issue type](https://github.com/damms005/laravel-multipay/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=addition-of-new-payment-handler.md&title=Addition+of+new+payment+handler+-+%5Bpayment+handler+name+here%5D).

> [!TIP]
> Adding a new payment handler is straight-forward. Simply add a class that extends `Damms005\LaravelMultipay\Services\PaymentHandlers\BasePaymentHandler` and implement `Damms005\LaravelMultipay\Contracts\PaymentHandlerInterface`

> [!NOTE]
> Payment providers that you so register as described above are resolvable from the [Laravel Container](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container) to improve the flexibility of this package and improve DX.

## Installation

1. Install via composer.

```bash
composer require damms005/laravel-multipay
```

1. Publish the config file.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-multipay-config
```

1. Run migrations.

```
php artisan migrate
```

### Demo Repo
I [published an open source app](https://github.com/damms005/nft-marketplace) that uses this payment package. It is also an excellent example of a Laravel app that uses [Laravel Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/vite#main-content) and leverages on [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/broadcasting#client-side-installation) to provide realtime experience via public and private channels using [Laravel Websocket](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets), powered by [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs).

### Test drive ðŸš€

Want to take things for a spin? Visit `/payment/test-drive` (`route('payment.test-drive')` provided by this package) .
For [Paystack](https://paystack.com), ensure to set `paystack_secret_key` key in the `laravel-multipay.php` config file that you published previously at installation. You can get your key from your [settings page](https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer).

> **Warning** <br />
> Ensure you have [TailwindCSS installed](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), then add this package's views to the `content` key of your `tailwind.config.js` configuration file, like below:
```
    content: [
        ...,
        './vendor/damms005/laravel-multipay/views/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
    ...
```

### Needed Third-party Integrations:

-   Flutterwave: If you want to use Flutterwave, ensure to get your API details [from the dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis), and use it to set the following variables in your `.env` file:

```
FLW_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
FLW_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
FLW_SECRET_HASH='My_lovelysite123'
```

-   Paystack: Paystack requires a secret key. Go to [the Paystack dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer) to obtain one, and use it to set the following variable:

```
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

-   Remita: Ensure to set the following environment variables:

```
REMITA_MERCHANT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
REMITA_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> For most of the above environment variables, you should rather use the (published) config file to set the corresponding values.

## Usage

### Typical process-flow

#### Step 1

Send a `POST` request to `/payment/details/confirm` (`route('payment.show_transaction_details_for_user_confirmation')` provided by this package).

Check the [InitiatePaymentRequest](src/Http/Requests/InitiatePaymentRequest.php#L28) form request class to know the values you are to post to this endpoint. (tip: you can also check [test-drive/pay.blade.php](views/test-drive/pay.blade.php)).

This `POST` request will typically be made by submitting a form from your frontend to the route described above.

> [!NOTE]
> if you need to store additional/contextual data with this payment, you can include such data in the request, in a field named `metadata`. The value must be a valid JSON string.

#### Step 2

Upon user confirmation of transaction, user is redirected to the appropriate payment handler's gateway.

#### Step 3

When user is done with the transaction on the payment handler's end (either successfully paid, or declined transaction), user is redirected
back to `/payment/completed` (`route('payment.finished.callback_url')` provided by this package) .

### Metadata Usage

In the payment initiation request in [Step 1](#step-1), you can provide a `metadata` field. This field is stored in the `metadata` column of the `payments` table, and available as `AsArrayObject::class` property of the `Payment` model and it provides powerful customization options for individual payments.

The metadata should be a valid JSON string containing key-value pairs that modify payment behavior.

#### Available Metadata Keys

**`completion_url`**
- After successful payment, the user will be redirected to the URL specified by this key instead of the default payment completion page
- When user is redirected to the specified URL, the transaction reference will be included as `transaction_reference` in the URL query string

**`payment_processor`**
- Use this key to dynamically set the payment handler for the specific transaction
- Valid values are any of [the providers listed above](#currently-supported-payment-handlers)
- This will override the default payment processor configuration

**`split_code`** (Paystack only)
- When using Paystack, you can use this key to specify a split code to process the transaction as a [Paystack Multi-split Transaction](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/multi-split-payments)
- This feature is only available when using Paystack as the payment handler

## Payment Conflict Resolution (PCR)

If for any reason, your user/customer claims that the payment they made was successful but that your platform did not reflect such successful payment, this PCR feature enables you to resolve such claims by simply calling:

```
/**
* @var bool //true if payment was successful, false otherwise
**/
$outcome = LaravelMultipay::reQueryUnsuccessfulPayment($payment)
```

The payment will be re-resolved and the payment will be updated in the database. If the payment is successful, the `SuccessfulLaravelMultipayPaymentEvent` event will be fired, so you can run any domain/application-specific procedures.

## WebHooks Payment Notifications (optional)
One of the benefits of this package is to remove the need for you to have to deal with payment webhooks. Depending on your needs, the event handling may suffice for your use case.

If you need webhook notifications from payment providers, use the webhook endpoint provided by this package: `route('payment.external-webhook-endpoint')`.

> If you use this payment notification URL feature, ensure that in the handler for `SuccessfulLaravelMultipayPaymentEvent`, you have not previously handled the event for that same payment.

## Events

### SuccessfulLaravelMultipayPaymentEvent

If there are additional steps you want to take upon successful payment, listen for `SuccessfulLaravelMultipayPaymentEvent`. This event will be fired whenever a successful payment occurs, with its corresponding `Payment` model.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
